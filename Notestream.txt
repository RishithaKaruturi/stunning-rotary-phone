A stream is an object which can produce and consume data.
In java streams are unidirectional.
.Byte Streams
.Character Streams
.Buffered Streams

ByteStreams:

    InputStream                                    Output Stream
FileInputStream                               FileOutputStream 
FilterInputStream                            FilterOutputStream
PipedInputStream                           PipedOutputStream
ObjectInputStream                         ObjectOutputStream
ByteArrayInputStream                   ByteArrayOutputStream
DataInputStream                             DataOutputStream

All the ByteStreams can be found in java.io package.

CharacterStreams:

Two topmost classes in the hierarchy of character streams....Reader,Writer.

   Reader                                                  Writer
FileReader                                           FileWriter
BufferedReader                                 BufferedWriter
FilterReader                                        FilterWriter
PipedReader                                       PipedWriter
CharArrayReader                              CharArrayWriter
